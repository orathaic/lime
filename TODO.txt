Rails:

Task Model / DB Table
- figure out how to autoincrement list-position field at DB level
  -  look into rails auto-increment


Backbone:
- nicer url:
  - create url should be set in Task Model / collection, not in a view

- Bugfix:
  - cannot properly archive / complete etc. newly created models.
  - When a list is edited, if you are viewing the list - the list view is not updated
      - need list to update if viewing list
      - otherwise nothing to happen
